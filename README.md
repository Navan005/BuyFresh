# BuyFresh is an ecommerce mobile application for buying groceries.
Through this project users will have a chance to choose from a wide range of options in every category, exclusively handpicked with best quality available at the lowest prices. Buy Fresh will allow its users to walk away from the drudgery of grocery shopping and will introduce an easy relaxed way of browsing and shopping for groceries. No more getting stuck in traffic jams, paying for parking, standing in long queues and carrying heavy bags â€“ get everything you need, when you need, right at your doorstep.
